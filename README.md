# Structure factor calculation for inifinite systems

This code is to calculate structure factor for systems that are simulated as infinite through Periodic Boundary Conditions.

It uses crystal theory to convolute the Fourier Transform and Lebedev quadratures to calculate powder averages, hence allowing a finer tuning in the wavenumbers availables.
